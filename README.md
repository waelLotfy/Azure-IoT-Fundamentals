Hands-on exploration of Azure IoT fundamentals including IoT Hub creation, device registration, secure telemetry ingestion, and monitoring.

# Azure IoT Fundamentals — Hands-on Exploration

## Overview
This repository documents hands-on labs focused on Azure IoT services completed as part of the AZ-900T00-A course.  
The work explores how Azure securely connects, authenticates, and monitors IoT devices using Azure IoT Hub.

---

## Labs Completed
- Create an Azure IoT Hub
- Register IoT devices
- Send telemetry data using a Raspberry Pi simulator
- Monitor IoT messaging activity

---

## Core Concepts Explored

### Azure IoT Hub
- Managed cloud service for IoT device communication
- Provides secure device authentication
- Supports telemetry ingestion and monitoring

### Device Identity and Security
- Each device has a unique identity
- Secure authentication is required for communication
- Prevents unauthorized device access

---

## Key Learnings
- Azure IoT Hub acts as a secure gateway between devices and the cloud.
- IoT devices must be registered and authenticated before sending data.
- Telemetry data can be ingested and monitored in real time.
- Azure provides metrics and monitoring for IoT messaging activity.

---

## Next Steps
- Explore IoT data processing and analytics.
- Integrate IoT Hub with storage and compute services.
- Apply security and governance to large‑scale IoT solutions.
